# Magnetic Resonance Engineering Logo

![logo](/SVG/MR_Engineering_logo.svg)

This repository contains several versions of a logo intended for the MR Engineering community. The logo consists of a typical gear to symbolize engineering, with at its interior a representation symbolizing a "spin", i.e., a particle with spin angular momentum and magnetic moment (e.g., a proton) as required to observe the magnetic resonance phenomenon.
Designs of different sizes, with text (below) and without text (above) are provided.
